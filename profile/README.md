# RdeV - River Valley High School Software Development Club

Welcome to **RdeV**, the official software development club of River Valley High School. We specialize in creating impactful software solutions and have worked on various projects for the school, events, and CCA activities.

## Our Projects

### 📝 PeerView
Our flagship project, **PeerView**, is a platform designed to help students share and discover online notes and resources with their peers. It’s built to facilitate a collaborative learning environment and make academic resources more accessible.

### 💻 RVCTF Website
We developed the official website for **RVCTF**, River Valley High School’s Capture the Flag event. The website hosts challenges and leaderboards for participants to compete and learn cybersecurity skills.

### 🌿 EcoTrail Website
We also created the website for the **EcoTrail** event, designed to promote environmental awareness within the school community.
